## üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture

The Soccer Predictor employs a sophisticated stacked ensemble model to predict football match outcomes. The architecture is designed to leverage the strengths of various machine learning algorithms, ensuring robust and accurate predictions. Below are the key components and innovations of the model:

### Ensemble Components

The model utilizes a stacked ensemble approach, combining the predictive power of several machine learning algorithms:

- **LightGBM**: Known for its efficiency and speed, LightGBM is used for handling large datasets and providing high accuracy.
- **XGBoost**: A powerful gradient boosting framework that excels in predictive performance, particularly for structured data.
- **Neural Networks**: Implemented using Keras, the neural network component is tailored for capturing complex patterns in the data.
- **Random Forest**: Provides robustness and reduces overfitting by averaging multiple decision trees.
- **AdaBoost**: Enhances the model's performance by focusing on difficult-to-predict instances.

### Neural Network Architecture

The neural network is constructed using Keras with the following architecture:

- **Layers**: Includes Dense, Dropout, BatchNormalization, and Activation layers.
- **Activation Functions**: Utilizes ReLU for hidden layers and linear activation for the output layer.
- **Regularization**: L2 regularization is applied to prevent overfitting.
- **Callbacks**: Incorporates EarlyStopping and a custom learning rate scheduler to optimize training.

### Stacking Methodology

The ensemble models are combined using a stacking regressor, with a Ridge regression model serving as the meta-learner. This approach allows the model to learn from the predictions of individual models, improving overall accuracy.

### Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is a critical component of the model, involving:

- **Polynomial Features**: Generated to capture non-linear relationships in the data.
- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**: Used for selecting the most relevant features, enhancing model performance.

### Data Flow

The data processing pipeline includes several stages:

1. **Data Gathering**: Automated scripts collect data from various sources.
2. **Odds Scraping**: Retrieves betting odds to incorporate into the model.
3. **Data Merging and Aggregation**: Combines and processes data for feature engineering.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Enhances data with additional features for improved predictions.
5. **Model Training**: Trains the ensemble model using historical data.
6. **Prediction**: Generates predictions for upcoming matches.

### Innovations

The model benefits from the domain knowledge of a late football player, incorporating insights into the sport's dynamics. This expertise is reflected in the feature engineering and model design, providing a unique edge in predicting match outcomes.

This architecture ensures that the Soccer Predictor is both powerful and flexible, capable of delivering high-accuracy predictions for football matches.
